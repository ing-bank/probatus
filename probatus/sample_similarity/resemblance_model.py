    This model checks the similarity of two samples.

    A possible use case is analysis of whether the train sample differs
    from the test sample, due to e.g. non-stationarity.

    It assigns labels to each sample, 0 to the first sample, 1 to the second. Then, it randomly selects a portion of
    data to train on. The resulting model tries to distinguish which sample a given test row comes from. This
    provides insights on how distinguishable these samples are and which features contribute to that. The feature
    importance is calculated using permutation importance.

    If the model achieves a test AUC significantly different than 0.5, it indicates that it is possible to distinguish
    between the samples, and therefore, the samples differ.
    Features with a high permutation importance contribute to that effect the most.
    Thus, their distribution might differ between two samples.

class SHAPImportanceResemblance(BaseResemblanceModel):
    """
    This model checks for similarity of two samples.

    A possible use case is analysis of whether the train sample differs
        from the test sample, due to e.g. non-stationarity.

    It assigns labels to each sample, 0 to the first sample, 1 to the second. Then, it randomly selects a portion of
        data to train on. The resulting model tries to distinguish which sample a given test row comes from. This
        provides insights on how distinguishable these samples are and which features contribute to that. The feature
        importance is calculated using SHAP feature importance.

    If the model achieves test AUC significantly different than 0.5, it indicates that it is possible to distinguish
        between the samples, and therefore, the samples differ. Features with a high permutation importance contribute
        to that effect the most. Thus, their distribution might differ between two samples.

    This class currently works only with the Tree based models.

    Examples:
    ```python
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from probatus.sample_similarity import SHAPImportanceResemblance
    X1, _ = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=5)
    X2, _ = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=5, shift=0.5)
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=2)
    rm = SHAPImportanceResemblance(clf)
    feature_importance = rm.fit_compute(X1, X2)
    rm.plot()
    ```

            scoring (string or probatus.utils.Scorer, optional):
                Metric for which the model performance is calculated. It can be either a metric name aligned with
                predefined
                [classification scorers names in sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html).

            random_state (int, optional):
                Random state set at each round of feature elimination. If it is None, the results will not be
                reproducible and in random search at each iteration a different hyperparameters might be tested. For
