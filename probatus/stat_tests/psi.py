def psi(d1, d2, verbose=False):
    """
    Calculates the Population Stability Index.

    A simple statistical test that quantifies the similarity of two distributions.
    Commonly used in the banking / risk modeling industry.
    Only works on categorical data or bucketed numerical data.
    Distributions must be binned/bucketed before passing them to this function.
    Bin boundaries should be the same for both distributions.
    Distributions must have the same number of buckets.
    Note that the PSI varies with number of buckets chosen (typically 10-20 bins are used).
    Quantile bucketing is typically recommended.

    Args:
        d1 (np.ndarray or pandas.Series): First distribution ("expected").

        d2 (np.ndarray or pandas.Series): Second distribution ("actual").

        verbose (bool): If True, useful interpretation info is printed to stdout.


    Returns:
        float: Measure of the similarity between d1 & d2. (range 0-inf, with 0 indicating identical
        distributions and > 0.25 indicating significantly different distributions)
        float: p-value for rejecting null hypothesis (that the two distributions are identical)
