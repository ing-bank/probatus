    Draws random train/test sample from the data using random seed and calculates metric of interest.

    Args:
        X (np.array or pd.DataFrame):
            Dataset with features.

        y (np.array or pd.Series):
            Target of the prediction.

        clf (model object):
            Binary classification model or pipeline.

        test_size (float):
            Fraction of data used for testing the model.

        split_seed (int):
            Randomized seed used for splitting data.

        scorers (list of Scorers):
            List of Scorer objects used to score the trained model.

        train_sampling_type (str, optional):
            String indicating what type of sampling should be applied on train set:

                - `None`: indicates that no additional sampling is done after splitting data,
                - `'bootstrap'`: indicates that sampling with replacement will be performed on train data,
                - `'subsample'`: indicates that sampling without repetition will be performed  on train data.

        test_sampling_type (str, optional):
            string indicating what type of sampling should be applied on test set:

                - `None`: indicates that no additional sampling is done after splitting data
                - `'bootstrap'`: indicates that sampling with replacement will be performed on test data
                - `'subsample'`: indicates that sampling without repetition will be performed  on test data

        train_sampling_fraction (float, optional):
            Fraction of train data sampled, if sample_train_type is not None. Default value is 1.

        test_sampling_fraction (float, optional):
            Fraction of test data sampled, if sample_test_type is not None. Default value is 1.

    Returns:
        (pd.Dataframe):
            Dataframe with results for a given model trained. Rows indicate the metric measured and columns their
                results.
