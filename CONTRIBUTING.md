# Contributing guide

`Probatus` aims to provide a set of tools that can speed up common workflows around validating regressors & classifiers and the data used to train them.
We're very much open to contributions but there are some things to keep in mind:

- Discuss the feature and implementation you want to add on Github before you write a PR for it. On disagreements, maintainer(s) will have the final word.
- Features need a somewhat general use case. If the use case is very niche it will be hard for us to consider maintaining it.
- If youâ€™re going to add a feature, consider if you could help out in the maintenance of it.
- When issues or pull requests are not going to be resolved or merged, they should be closed as soon as possible. This is kinder than deciding this after a long period. Our issue tracker should reflect work to be done.

That said, there are many ways to contribute to Probatus, including:

- Contribution to code
- Improving the documentation
- Reviewing merge requests
- Investigating bugs
- Reporting issues

Starting out with open source? See the guide [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) and have a look at [our issues labelled *good first issue*](https://github.com/ing-bank/probatus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Setup

Development install:

```shell
pip install -e '.[all]'
```

Unit testing:

```shell
pytest
```

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to ensure code styling. Install with:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Now if you install it (which you are encouraged to do), you are encouraged to do the following command before committing your work:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This will allow you to quickly see if the work you made contains some adaptions that you still might need to make before a pull request is accepted.

## Standards

- Python 3.9+
- Follow [PEP8](http://pep8.org/) as closely as possible (except line length)
- [google docstring format](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Git: Include a short description of *what* and *why* was done, *how* can be seen in the code. Use present tense, imperative mood
- Git: limit the length of the first line to 72 chars. You can use multiple messages to specify a second (longer) line: `git commit -m "Patch load function" -m "This is a much longer explanation of what was done"`


### Code structure

* Model validation modules assume that trained models passed for validation are developed in a scikit-learn framework (i.e. have predict_proba and other standard functions), or follow a scikit-learn API e.g. XGBoost.
* Every python file used for model validation needs to be in `/probatus/`
* Class structure for a given module should have a base class and specific functionality classes that inherit from base. If a given module implements only a single way of computing the output, the base class is not required.
* Functions should not be as short as possible in terms of lines of code. If a lot of code is needed, try to put together snippets of code into other functions. This make the code more readable, and easier to test.
* Classes follow the probatus API structure:
    * Each class implements `fit()`, `compute()` and `fit_compute()` methods. `fit()` is used to fit an object with provided data (unless no fit is required), and `compute()` calculates the output e.g. DataFrame with a report for the user. Lastly, `fit_compute()` applies one after the other.
    * If applicable, the `plot()` method presents the user with the appropriate graphs.
    * For `compute()` and `plot()`, check if the object is fitted first.


### Documentation

Documentation is a very crucial part of the project because it ensures usability of the package. We develop the docs in the following way:

* We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. The `docs/` folder contains all the relevant documentation.
* We use `mkdocs serve` to view the documentation locally. Use it to test the documentation everytime you make any changes.
* Maintainers can deploy the docs using `mkdocs gh-deploy`. The documentation is deployed to `https://ing-bank.github.io/probatus/`.
